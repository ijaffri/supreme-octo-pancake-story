This story begins with an xteam working together on a project, named alex, bob, clark, and debbie. They are all in a CS course at a university in florida, and find out that 
they forgot to turn in a big project by the due date, and will fail the course unless they do very well in the following project. This story begins with them realizing 
that they forgot to turn in the project, and they meet at the library. 

The x-team members meet up at the library, but Alex gets lost on the way. Bob tries to text Alex, but he doesn't know that Alex's phone died, so he ends up waiting for three hours.
 Bob is devestated and realizes that he may have to do the project all alone. 

Suddenly, they came up with a big idea. If they are able to fly to Mars and live a life there, they can get rid of those homework forever.

So they switch their majors to aerospace engineering, not realizing that it is much more work. They all graduate with honors and join spaceX, where they create the rocket they wanted.
 As they approach the red planet, they realize that they didn't bring a renewable source of oxygen. "We really should've just submitted that assignment on time." Said Clark, mockingly.

As they began to lost conciousness, Alex wakes up from his dream. It was just a nightmare. He checks the clock, and he has the time to finish the assignment. The moral of the story is...
START YOUR ASSIGNMENTS EARLY!
